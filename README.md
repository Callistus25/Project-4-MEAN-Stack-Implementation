# Project-4-MEAN-Stack-Implementation

Update 1:
I commenced MEAN stack Implementation with great enthusiasm, running on ubuntu 22. When i tried to install Mongodb on Ubuntu 22, the packages was not located. I researched on Mongodb site and found that there is an in complete package build for installing mongodb on ubuntu 22, There were some workarounds which wasnt clear. I restarted the project, created a fresh instance on ubuntu 20 and have been able to install mongodb. This is an added experience. 

Update 2:
Finally, i was able to complete the project after 7 hours. Had issue completing the configuration and running the web page using public IP and DNS. After much troubleshooting and changing of my terminal tool, issue was resolved.
