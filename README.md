# Project-4-MEAN-Stack-Implementation

I commenced Project 4 with great enthusiasm, running on ubuntu 22. When i tried to install Mongodb on Ubuntu 22, the packages was located. I researchedd on Mongodb site and found that there is an in complete package build for installing mongodb on ubuntu 22, There were some workarounds which wasnt clear. i restarted the project, created a fresh instance on ubuntu 20 and have been able to install mongodb. This is an added experience. 

Finally i was able to complete the project after 7 hours. Had issue completing the confguration and running the web page using public IP and DNS. Ater much troubleshooting and changing of my terminal tool, issue ws resolved.
